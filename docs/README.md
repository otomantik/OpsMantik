# OpsMantik - Knowledge Base

This is the canonical source of truth for the OpsMantik platform. The documentation is organized into four core pillars for clarity and maintainability.

---

## 🏛️ The Four Pillars

1.  **[Architecture (ARCH.md)](ARCH.md)**
    *   System design, database partitioning, and real-time engine overview.
2.  **[API Specification (API.md)](API.md)**
    *   Endpoint definitions, request/response schemas, and CORS security.
3.  **[Operations (OPS.md)](OPS.md)**
    *   SLA/SLO specifications, monitoring (Watchtower), and incident runbooks.
4.  **[Security (SECURITY.md)](SECURITY.md)**
    *   PII scrubbing, RLS policies, and platform hardening rules.
