Build requires npm install first (adds @radix-ui/react-dialog, @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu).

> npm install
> npm run build

Expected after install:
  Creating an optimized production build ...
  ✓ Compiled successfully
  (TypeScript step may hit EPERM in some environments — run locally to confirm.)

Build error in this environment (before install):
  Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dialog'
  Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu'

Run locally: npm install && npm run build
